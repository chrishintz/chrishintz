  <h1> My Story</h1>
  <img src="/css/Photos/paw_chris.PNG" class="profile_pic"/>
  <p>
    I was born in Bellevue, Washington.  I lived the first 18 years of my life in the same house which meant by the end of high school I was ready to try out another part of the country and moved to Atlanta, GA to attend <a href="http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html"> Emory University</a> and study Accounting and Finance.
  </p>

  <p>
    After college, I moved to Denver, Colorado to work as an auditor for <a href="http://www.pwc.com/"> PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), </a> working in the Energy, Mining, and Real Estate industries. After three years, my westward journey continued as I moved to San Jose, California to work in PwC's Transaction Services, Financial Due Diligence group focusing on technology companies.  While in the Bay Area, I found myself more intrested in the technology side of the businesses I worked on rather than the accounting/finance side.

    After one year in the Bay Area, I returned home to Seattle, continuing to work with PwC as an outside consultant before joining Code Builders to train to become a developer. In my free time, I enjoys hiking and biking around the beautiful Pacific Northwest with my girlfriend, <a href ="https://twitter.com/callapatel" target="_blank">Calla</a>, and my dog, Pawpea.
